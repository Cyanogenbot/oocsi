# Welcome to OOCSI!

![Open Source Love](https://badges.frapsoft.com/os/v1/open-source.png?v=103) 

The OOCSI mission is to create a simple systems-interaction fabric for use by designers in academia and industry.

OOCSI is a prototyping middleware for designing distributed products and it is targeted mainly at Industrial Design and Computer Science education. OOCSI supports multiple client platforms that allow prototyping connected products and systemic designs with various heterogeneous components from embedded to mobile to the cloud. In the past years, OOCSI has been used by hundreds of students, educators, and researchers, and it is continuously developed as an open-source project with feedback from the community.

## Getting started

There are many cases, in which OOCSI can support connected prototyping and communication between devices and platforms. For example, connecting a sensor on an embedded platform to a data logger or visualisation on a mobile device. Or connecting the sensor to other devices in the same context to share data within a local system.

Before you head to our [wiki](https://github.com/iddi/oocsi/wiki), try to think about which types of devices or platforms you need to connect, then check the support platforms below. All repositories below have introductory information about how to connect to OOCSI.

## Supported platforms

* Processing ([GitHub repository](https://github.com/iddi/oocsi-processing))
* Java/Android ([GitHub repository](https://github.com/iddi/oocsi))
* Python ([GitHub repository](https://github.com/iddi/oocsi-python))
* Javascript (HTML/Web) ([GitHub repository](https://github.com/iddi/oocsi-websocket))
* Javascript (Node.js) ([GitHub repository](https://github.com/iddi/oocsi-nodejs))
* ESP (via Arduino IDE) ([GitHub repository](https://github.com/iddi/oocsi-esp))
